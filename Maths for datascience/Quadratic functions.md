* General form: ax2 + bx + c
* The graph is called parabola
* some important terms
	* Axis of symmetry: a line that divides the parabola into two equal parts
	* Vertex: The point along which the vertex of symmetry is drawn
	* Y intercept of a quadratic function is c
* Axis of symmetry
	* $x = -b/2a$
		* la
* X-coordinate of vertex = $-b/2a$
* Minimum or maximum values:
	* If a > 0, it will have a maximum value
	* If a < 0, it will have a minimum value
* Slope of a quadratic equation:
	* f = 2ax + b
