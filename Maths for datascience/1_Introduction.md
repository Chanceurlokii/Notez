* Repeated addition is called multiplication
* Repeated multiplication is called exponentiation
* Division is repeated subtraction
* 16 mod 5 = 1
* a divides b if ***b mod a = 0*** and it is denoted by ***a|b***
* Greatest Common Divisor = the largest number that divides two numbers
* Types of numbers:
	* Real numbers
		* Includes rational and irrational numbers
		* Irrational numbers are numbers that could not be expressed in the form of p/q
		* example: $\sqrt2$, $\pi$, e
	* Rational numbers: 
		* Any number that could be expressed in the form of ***p/q*** where p and q are integers.
		* Representation is not unique
		* They are dense (Between any two rationals more rationals could be found)
	* Integers: 
		* Extends the natural numbers with negative numbers (-$\infty$ to $\infty$)
		* They are discrete (For any integer there is next and previous integer)
	* Natural numbers
		* All positive integers from 0 to $\infty$
		* Generally to avoid confusion as to natural numbers consist of 0 or not, N$_0$ is used to represent Natural numbers including zero
		* Multiplication and addition of two natural numbers always result in a natural number.
	* Prime numbers
		* Only have two factors, 1 and itself
		* Sieve of erastosthenes
			* simple method. Not efficient.
			* remove multiples of all numbers
