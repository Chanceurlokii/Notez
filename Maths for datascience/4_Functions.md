* A rule that maps inputs to outputs.
* Need to specify input and output sets
	* Domain: Input set
	* Codomain: Output set of possible values
	* Range: Actual values that the output can take
* Properties of R$_f$  
	* For each x $\in$ domain(f) there is a pair (x,y) $\in$ R$_f$
	* Single valued. for every x $\in$ domain(f), there is exactly one y $\in$ codomain(f) such that (x,y) $\in$ R$_f$
* Plotting the results of a function
	* f(x) = 3.5x + 5.7
		* 3.5 is the slope of the line
		* 5.7 is the y intercept of the line, when x = 0

### Types of functions
1. ***Injective***: Different inputs produce different outputs. ***One to one functions***.
2. ***Surjective***: Range is the Codomain - ***Onto functions***.
	* For every **y** $\in$ Codomain(f), there is an x $\in$ domain(f) such that f(x) = y
3. ***Bijective***: 1 - 1 correspondence between domain and codomain
	* Every x in domain(f) maps to a unique y in codomain(f)
	* Every y in codomain(f) maps to a unique pre-image of x in domain(f) such that y = f(x)
	* A function is Bijective ONLY if it is both injective and surjective.
