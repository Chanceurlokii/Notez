* Cartesian Product - Order is important
* Binary relations
	* combination of cartesian product and set comprehension
* Relations describes special tuples in a cartesian product
* Types of binary relation:
	* ***Identity relation***:  Maps every element to itself. Set comprehension of two copies of same set. 
		* `I = {(a,b)|(a,b)`$\in$ `A x A, a=b}`
	* ***Reflexive relation***: Element related to itself. Has identity pairs AND  other pairs also.
		* `{(a,b)|(a,b)`$\in$$\mathbb{N}$ x $\in$$\mathbb{N}$, ` a,b > 0, a|b}`
	* ***Symmetric relation***: Both the orders of elements must be true. For every pair of elements, the mirrored pair must also be true.
	* ***Transitive relation***: It makes a certain condition apply to an element transitively because of a factor relating them. 
		* Example: If 2|6 and 6|36, then 2|36.
	* ***Antisymmetric relation***: If one order of a pair exists, the reverse MUST NOT be true.
	* ***Equivalence relation***: 
		* Partitions a set
		* Groups of equivalent elements are called equivalence classes.
		* They are Reflexive, symmetric and transitive
* Tables as relations:
	* Some columns are special- ex. each student has a unique roll number
	* Such a column is called a ${key}$
