* A set is a collection of items
* Set may be infinite
	* Example:   $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$
* Duplicates are not counted separately.
* Cardinality: Number of items in a set.
* Not every collection of items is a set
	* Collection of all sets is not a set
	* Russell's paradox {Also discovered by Ernst Zermelo}
		* Consider a set ***S***, all sets that do not contain themselves
		* S is a set by set comprehension
		* Now S belongs to S?
		* If yes, Contradiction: Elements of S do not contain themselves
		* If no,  Contradiction: Sets that do not contain themselves should be in S
* items in a set are called ***elements***
* Every set is a subset of itself
* Subsets
	* X is a subset of Y if every element of X is also an element of Y
* Empty set has no elements and denoted by $\phi$
* Power set
	* Ser of all subsets of a set
	* Set with ***n*** elements has ***2$^n$*** subsets

## Set comprehension
* A way to interpret and express sets in a systematic way
* Example: The subset of even integers: {x | x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, x mod 2 = 0}
	* Begin with an existing set $\mathbb{Z}$ 
	* Apply a condition to each element in that set
	* Collect all the elements and form a new subset that satisfies the condition
* Intervals
	* Open intervals - Excludes endpoints - denoted by (0,1)
	* Closed intervals- Includes endpoints - denoted by `[0,1]`

## Set operations
* ***Union***: Combines two sets - combines all elements of X and Y {Denoted by $\cup$}
* ***Intersection***: Collects elements that are common to X and Y{Denoted by $\cap$}
* ***Set difference***: Elements in one set and not in another {Denoted by ``\ or -``}
* ***Complement***: Elements not in X, $\bar{X}$, X$^c$ 
	* Define compliment relative to a larger set(universe)
	* Complement of Prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ are Composite numbers
	* The universe is natural numbers, Prime numbers is subset and composite numbers is the complement
