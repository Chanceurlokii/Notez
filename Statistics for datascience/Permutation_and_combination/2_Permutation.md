* Ordered arrangement of terms
* The number of possible permutations of ***r*** objects from a collection of ***n*** distinct objects(When repetition is **NOT** allowed)
	* $^n$P$_r$
	* $^n$P$_r$ = n! / (n-r)!
* Permutations of ***r*** objects from collection of ***n*** distinct objects.(When repetition is allowed)
	* n$^r$
* Rearranging letters of a word:
	* ***n*** letters to be re-arranged and the repeated letters(if there are any) are to be treated as distinct objects
		* Permutations = ***n!***
	* ***n*** letters are to be re-arranged and repeated letters(***r***) are treated as same
		* Permutations = ***n!/r!***
*Example:
STATISTICS
n=10 | r$_1$(S) = 3 | r$_2$(T) = 3 | r$_3$(I) = 2 
permutations = 10!/3!3!2! = 50,400 ways*
* Circular permutations: 
	* clockwise and anti-clockwise are different
		* Permutations = (n-1)!
	* Clockwise and anti-clockwise are same
		* Permutations =(n-1)! / 2
