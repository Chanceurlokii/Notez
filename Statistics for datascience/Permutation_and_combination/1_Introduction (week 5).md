Counting with order -> Permutation
Counting without regard to order -> Combination

## Addition rule of counting: 
1. ***N*** sets. {***A*** and ***B*** as per the example}
2. Only one could be selected from one of the sets.
3. The number of choices available = sum of cardinalities of sets {cardinalities of A(5) and B(2) which is ***7***)}

`Example: Two sets A and B, contains 5 shirts and 2 pants respectively. The number of ways one can choose either a shirt or a pant is sum of cardinality of A and B, i.e. 5+2 = 7.` ^be7279

## Multiplication rule of counting: 
1. ***N*** sets.
2. 1 from each could be selected. 
3. Then the number of choices available is product of cardinality of sets.
`Example: Considering the same example as given for` [[#^be7279]] `The choices available to choose from one shirt and one pant would be multiplication of 5 and 2, which is 10`

## Factorial:
The product of the first ***n*** positive integers. denoted by "***!***"
***5!*** signifies <b>5*4*3*2*1</b> which is 120.
